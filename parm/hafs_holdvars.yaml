## Holdvars variable generation section.
# This sets variables that are only used to create the holdvars file.
# Note that you must also edit parm/hafs_holdvars.txt in order for the
# values in this section to be sent to the holdvars.txt file.
#
# These variables are set automatically by hafs.launcher.make_holdvars:
# -   cap_run_gsi --- YES/NO from [config] run_gsi
# -   cap_run_vortexinit --- YES/NO from [config] run_vortexinit
# -   holdvars_model --- from [config] run_ocean to 
#                      COUPLED (true) or ATMOS (false)
# They are set in the [holdvars] section.
